# Data Warehouse

 ETL pipeline that extracts data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for the analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. Tests the database and ETL pipeline by running queries given by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare our results with their expected results.
